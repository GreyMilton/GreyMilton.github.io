        <p>Hello and welcome!</p>
        <p>My name is Grey Milton. I am newly trained full-stack software developer, who has recently undertaken an industry leading <a href="https://northcoders.com" target="_blank">coding bootcamp</a>. I have created this portfolio website to showcase some of the coding projects I have completed over the past few months.</p>
        <p>Originally a musician by trade, I have long had strengths in mathematics and the visual arts, with an eye and disposition to fine details. I initally dipped my feet into coding when helping my wife with her online business, by designing and tweaking the CSS for two websites: <a href="https://www.gettingnaked.com.au" target="_blank">gettingnaked.com.au</a> and <a href="https://www.yogaforthevagina.com" target="_blank">yogaforthevagina.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>In a fortunate string of events, I found my way to the bootcamp course on the advice of a lifelong friend and coder, and I have now learnt a vast array of new skills and concepts including JavaScript, React, React Native, RESTful APIs, TDD with Jest and Supertest, PostgreSQL and much more.</p>
        <p>I am excited to be embarking on this new career in Software Development, soaking up any chance I can to learn and grow my skillset.</p>
        <p>Please enjoy this portfolio website, and even dig deeper into the linked GitHub repos if you're interested. And please contact me if you have any questions or comments on what you see.</p>
        <p>All the best,<br/>Grey
