        <p>Hello and welcome!</p>

        <p>My name is Grey Milton. I am a Full Stack Software Developer, who created this portfolio website after graduating from an industry leading <a href="https://northcoders.com" target="_blank">coding bootcamp at Northcoders</a> in late 2021. This portfolio showcases some of the projects I completed over an intensive 13 weeks of learning.</p>

        <p>Originally a musician by trade, I have long had strengths in mathematics, philosophy and the visual arts. With a keen eye and disposition to fine details, I initially dipped my feet into coding when helping my wife with her online business, by designing and tweaking the CSS for two of her websites: <a href="https://www.gettingnaked.com.au" target="_blank">gettingnaked.com.au</a> and <a href="https://www.yogaforthevagina.com" target="_blank">yogaforthevagina.com</a>.
        </p>

        <p>In a fortunate string of events, I found my way to the bootcamp course on the advice of a lifelong friend and coder, where I learnt and deepened a vast array of skills and concepts including JavaScript (including the DOM and ES6 syntax), React, React Native, RESTful APIs, TDD with Jest and Supertest, PostgreSQL, Agile methodologies and more.</p>


        <p>Since then, as of May 2023, I have worked full time as a Full Stack Software Developer for over 14 months. In this time I have primarily worked with JavaScript, PHP, Vue.js, Inertia.js, Laravel PHP and Tailwind CSS. All work in my current role has been in-house and unfortunately can't be shared publicly, but I have recently had a little spare time to work on a couple of repos which I happily can share. They can be found on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GreyMilton">Github page</a></p>

        <p>I am particularly excited about a new open source Vue.js component library I have started called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GreyMilton/vue-classy-components">vue-classy-components</a>, designed to provide components that are as easy, intuitive and flexible to style as possible. I conceived this after experiencing several difficult to style packages myself. I built a similar component library in my current work role for the whole team to use across several projects, but I'm now looking forward to making an even more considered, easier to use library that can be used freely by all.</p>

        <p>Please browse this portfolio website and my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GreyMilton">Github repos</a> at your leisure. If you have any questions or comments on what you find, feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
        <p>All the best,<br/>Grey
